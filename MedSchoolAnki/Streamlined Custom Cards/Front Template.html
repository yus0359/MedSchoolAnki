How to create custom fields: 

Say you want a new field for UWorld questions specifically.
1. Create the new field in the Notes->manage note types interface
2. Within the cards->back template interface, copy a section, for example, #Missed questions. Place it where you want it.
3. Rename to "UWorld" within ALL the brackets of the copied section.

Both these interfaces are accessible via the card browser. For #2, you must copy the entire section within {{#Section}}{{/Section}} and spelling must be EXACT, except within the <summary>this is the summary</summary> brackets.

Anki allows you to quickly convert cards of one type to another, but you'll have to google how to do that.
